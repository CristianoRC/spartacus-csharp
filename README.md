  - Access many types of databases in a generic way;
  - Communication between client and server;
  - Easy to work with cryptography of files and messages;
  - Really fast import and export spreadsheets (CSV and XLSX), with no need of Excel or any other piece of software;
  - Compress and uncompress zip files;
