Spartacus is a multi-purpose library written in C#, focused on:
  - Access many types of databases in a fast, easy to use and generic way;
  - Render reports from a unique XML markup to PDF, using own database objects;
  - Really fast import and export spreadsheets (CSV, DBF and XLSX), with no need of Excel or any other piece of software;
  - Communication between client and server;
  - Easy to work with cryptography of files and messages;
  - Compress and uncompress zip files.

Examples of how to use Spartacus are here: https://github.com/wind39/spartacus/wiki

Please note that Spartacus is not API ready yet, something may change until it becomes stable.
